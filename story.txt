Long, long ago, when all the animals could talk, there lived in the province of Inaba in Japan, a little white hare.
 His home was on the island of Oki, and just across the sea was the mainland of Inaba.
Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba. Day after day he would go out 
and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of Inaba, and day after day he hoped to find some way of
 getting across.

One day as usual, the hare was standing on the beach, looking towards the mainland across the water, when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island.
